Consortium has finished the first truly complete 3.055 billion base pair (bp) sequence of a human genome, 
representing the largest improvement to the human reference genome since its initial release. The new 
T2T-CHM13 reference includes gapless assemblies for all 22 autosomes plus Chromosome X, corrects numerous 
errors, and introduces nearly 200 million bp of novel sequence containing 2,226 paralogous gene copies, 115 of 
which are predicted to be protein coding.

configuration options. Mamba is an almost complete rewrite of Conda in C++, allows for parallel downloading of 
data, and has much faster and better dependency resolving compared to Conda. Yet you should still use Conda 
for its activation and deactivation.

* http://lolaweb.databio.org - LOLAweb is a web server and interactive results viewer for enrichment of 
overlap between a user-provided query region set (a bed file) and a database of region sets. It provides an
